# Inferences in regression and Correlation Analysis

The model for this section is

$Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X_{i}+\varepsilon_{i}$

where: 


* $Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}$ are parameters

* $X_{i}$ are known constants

* $\varepsilon_{i}$ are independent $\sim N(0,\sigma^{2})$


## 2.1 Inferences concerning $\beta_{1}$

$H_{0}: \beta_{1}=0$

$H_{a}: \beta_{1}\ne0$

When $\beta_{1}=0$ then there is no relationship between Y and X because the distributions of Y are identical for all levels of X, and  $E[Y]=\beta_{0}+(0)X=\beta_{0}$

### The sampling distribution of $b_{1}$

#### **Linear combination**

The point estimator of $b_{1}=\frac{\sum(X_{i}-\bar{X})(Y_{i}-\bar{Y})}{\sum(X_{i}-\bar{X})^{2}}$

The sampling distribution of $b_{1}$ describes the different values of $b_{1}$ that would occur with repeated sampling when the levels of X are held constant from sample to sample.

$\sum(X_{i}-\bar{X})(Y_{i}-\bar{Y}) = \sum(X_{i}-\bar{X})(Y_{i})-\sum(X_{i}-\bar{X})(\bar{Y})$

$\sum(X_{i}-\bar{X})(\bar{Y})=(\bar{Y})\sum(X_{i}-\bar{X})=0$ because $\sum(X_{i}-\bar{X})=0$

therefore $b_{1}=\frac{\sum(X_{i}-\bar{X})(Y_{i}-\bar{Y})}{\sum(X_{i}-\bar{X})^{2}}=\frac{\sum(X_{i}-\bar{X})(Y_{i})}{\sum(X_{i}-\bar{X})^{2}}=\sum k_{i}Y_{i}$

therefore $b_{1}$ is a linear combination of $Y{i}$

$\sum k_{i}=\frac{\sum(X_{i}-\bar{X})}{\sum(X_{i}-\bar{X})^{2}}=0$

$\sum k_{i}^{2}=\sum [\frac{(X_{i}-\bar{X})}{\sum(X_{i}-\bar{X})^{2}}]^{2}=\frac{1}{\sum(X_{i}-\bar{X})^{2}}$

#### **Distribution**

$b_{1}$ is a linear combination of $Y_{i}$ which are iid Normally distributed and therefore is normally distributed itself.

#### **Mean**
